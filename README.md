### Introduction ###
CrateDB is a distributed SQL database management system that integrates a fully searchable document oriented data store. It is open-source, written in Java, based on a shared nothing architecture, and is designed for high scalability and includes components from Facebook Presto, Apache Lucene, Elasticsearch and Netty.
To fast deploy of CrateDB on server/s, I wrote `ansible-crate` project by Ansible. In this project, CrateDB will automatic deploy with Docker.

### Dependency ###
To use `ansible-crate` project you need some packages for deploying it, in your Ansible machine you need this package:

* ansible


### Deploy ###
To deploy `ansible-crate` project, after clone the project in your Ansible machine, enter your server/s IP address and `node_name` in hosts file:

```
vi hosts
```

After that set information of your environment in variable file:

```
vi group_vars/all
```

Now for running Ansible Playbook you should run the beneath command:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts main-playbook.yml
```
